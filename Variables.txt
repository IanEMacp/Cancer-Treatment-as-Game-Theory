For the sake of convenience we should rename every variable in the math equations for use in our code. Below are the renames that have 
alredy been established.

r = growthRate
N = populationSize
K = carryCapacity
v = heritable
d1 = drug1Mortality
d2 = drug2Mortality
y1 = drug1Concentration
y2 = drug2Concentration
v1 = drug1Investment
v2 = drug2Investment
k1 = drug1Resistance
k2 = drug2Resistance
beta = magnitude
